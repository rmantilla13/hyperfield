# Third-party notices

OpenField's own code is MIT (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). It **redistributes no
model weights and no ComfyUI custom nodes**. Weights are downloaded by you, from
their publishers, by `npm run models` or by the node packs on first use. Each one
stays under its own license, listed below. Accepting those licenses, and
following them, is up to you.

Licenses were checked against each primary source (Hugging Face model card or
LICENSE file, GitHub repo LICENSE, npm or PyPI metadata) on 2026-10-17. Where a
source did not say, the table says **unverified**. This is a summary, not legal
advice. The linked license text is what binds you.

**Commercial use** means running the model for paid or revenue-generating work.

| Mark | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Yes** | Commercial use permitted under the license's normal conditions. |
| **Yes, under $10M** | Free under US$10M yearly revenue (affiliates counted together). Above that, a paid license from the publisher. |
| **NO (non-commercial)** | Non-commercial use only. |
| **GEO-RESTRICTED** | Not licensed at all in some countries. |

ComfyUI, VideoHelperSuite and KJNodes are GPL-3.0. OpenField talks to ComfyUI over its
HTTP API as a separate program and ships none of its code, so OpenField itself
stays MIT.

Not used: `kabachuha/ltx2-hydraulic-press` states no license on its card, so
OpenField does not fetch or offer it.

## Keeping this file honest

The model license strings shown in the app and in
[`docs/MODELS.md`](docs/MODELS.md) come from `server/models.ts`. If you add a
model, update both that file and this one.
